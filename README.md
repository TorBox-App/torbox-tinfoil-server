#### About

The TorBox Tinfoil Server allows you to easily set up your own custom Tinfoil shop of curated items downloaded from TorBox. This allows you to use TorBox as a repository rather than storing your files on your own server, or relying on someone else to download them for you. 

#### Important Notice
TorBox does not allow piracy or condone it in any way. This is meant to be used with games you own and have the rights to.
